## CRA

- Art 11

Het toestel in kwestie is geen MDR, Medical Devices Regulation, dus het valt wel onder CRA.

health data not falling under the scope of the MDR. See [23, p. 483]: “with reference to Article 2(1) of
the MDR, the threshold between a ‘medical’ and ‘non-medical’ device is the “intended purpose”: whether
the device is intended to be used by the manufacturer, alone or in combination, for one of the listed “spe-
cific medical purposes”. The recent rise of consumer (well-being, lifestyle) health devices has blurred the
borderline between ‘medical’ and ‘non-medical’ devices”
